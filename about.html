	<p style="margin:0px">Murari's Kitchen specializes in handcrafted sandwiches, salads, pastas  and sauces made with fresh ingredients and lots of love. At Murari's Kitchen we take the time and effort to make your sandwich the best you’ll ever have. 
	<br/><br/>
	Some people say we must have a secret…but really great sandwiches just take a little more time, effort, and the best quality ingredients. 
	<br/><br/>
	Our sandwiches are so delicious because we let you decide how you like your sandwich. Making and pricing our sandwiches to order ensures you get what you want and pay for exactly what you get.
	
	<br/><br/>
	We use only the best quality veggies and breads. We use whole leaf lettuce (we do not purchase pre-shredded, chemical-treated lettuce)<br/>
	We slice our own tomatoes, onions, and pickles daily – yes, it makes a huge difference
	<br/><br/>
	We use whole imported Italian marinated red and yellow peppers to make our famous pepper spread and In-house Chutney's are our “secret ingredient”
